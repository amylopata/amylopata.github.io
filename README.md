## Abstract
Wheelchair users and other mobility-impaired individuals often face access barriers such as stairs, steep slopes, and narrow pathways when navigating outdoor spaces. Many of the existing accessibility maps and wayfinding applications source their data through inefficient methods such as manual surveys and crowd-sourcing. Consequently, they typically lack specific, accurate, and current accessibility information. This paper proposes the use of aerial photogrammetry, artificial intelligence, and geographic information system (GIS) analysis to automate the identification of wheelchair accessible outdoor pathways. This paper considers a case study of Carnegie Mellon University's campus and measures the degree of wheelchair accessibility using the 2010 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards for ramp slopes and walking surface width. The proposed methodology could be extended in future research to include other ADA standards such as surface quality and the presence of curb cuts. The wheelchair accessibility information provided by this methodology can be used by wheelchair users to identify accessible routes of travel and by facility managers and government agencies to survey and correct access barriers along pedestrian pathways.
